# file-encryptor
A .txt file encryptor using rust. This program simply takes the contents of encryptme.txt (which is in the txtencrypt/src/ directory), then encrypts the contents with an aes-gcm algorithm from the aes-gcm crate created by the RustCrypto group, and puts the encrypted bytes into encrypted.txt. Keep in mind, the aes-gcm algorithm that I used has not been formally tested and proven to be completely secure.
